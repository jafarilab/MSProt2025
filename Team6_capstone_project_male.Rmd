# üß¨ Capstone Project: R-based Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Workflow
  
#This document provides a step-by-step guide for your capstone project on analyzing proteomics data using R.

---
  
## üîÅ Workflow Overview
  ### 1. üìÅ Dataset Acquisition  
  #**Input:** PRIDE PXD Identifier  
 
#(*Example: `PXD0123456`, accessible via [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/)*)

#Use the `rpx` package to access metadata and download a dataset that includes `.mzID` files from a published study.
```{r}
library(rpx)
px <- PXDataset("PXD054726")  #male
pxfiles(px) ## Retrieve and display a list of all files associated with the PXDataset object 'px'

```

```{r}
files <- pxfiles(px) #Retrieve and display a list of all files associated with the PXDataset object 'px'
mzid_files <- pxget(px, grep("mzid", pxfiles(px))) #Identify the .mzID files from the retrieved files
```


---
  
### 2. üß± PSM Object Creation & Preprocessing  
#**Goal:** Generate a PSM (Peptide-Spectrum Match) object from `.mzID` files  
 
#- Convert `.mzID` files into `PSM` objects
# Assess:
# Number of decoy hits
# Score distributions
# PSM rank
# Apply filtering based on FDR or identification score

```{r}
library(PSMatch)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
psms <- PSM(mzid_files, parser = 'mzID') #Convert .mzID files into PSM objects
```

```{r}
names(psms)
```
```{r}
# PSM rank
#    * Number of decoy hits
#no isdecoy column
library("dplyr")
psm_df <- tidyr::as_tibble(psms)
psm_df
#Converted into dataframe because it is just easier to check in environment and easier to work on for me. 
sum(is.na(psm_df$description)) #0 #one way is to check if there are proteins without description. -> No NAs in description
#Another idea we discussed was that if the peak score is low (for eg 0), they could be removed as decoy. So I will come back to that in later step after score distribution
```


```{r}
#    * Number of decoy hits
#no isdecoy column
#Converted into tibble because it is just easier to check in environment and easier to work on for me. as  hist script :) 
sum(is.na(psm_df$description)) #0 #one way is to check if there are proteins without description. -> No NAs in description
#Another idea we discussed was that if the peak score is low (for eg 0), they could be removed as decoy. So I will come back to that in later step after score distribution
```



```{r}
#Score distributions
# Score distributions
score_distribution <- summary(psms@listData$`mascot:score`)
print(score_distribution)
#hist(psms@listData$`mascot:score`, breaks = 100) #one way to do histogram

table(psm_df$passthreshold) #true#76701  may be after removing decoys or delta score or mascot score thereshold?

```
```{r}

#when filtering one plan is to remove everything at 0. just exploring where to filter

### 3. üß¨ Protein & Peptide Identification  
# **Goal:** Determine identified peptides and proteins  
#Count the number of identified peptides and proteins

length(unique(psm_df$accession)) #proteins? #598 number of proteins
```

```{r}
adj <- makeAdjacencyMatrix(psms) #this one is without the mascot.score <0 removed because i dont know how to convert tibble to psm again. but rank 1 is filtered. 
dim(adj)

cx <- connectedComponents(cc, 326) #plotting this for simplicity because this component has low number of rows 17 rows(fragments?)
cx
plotAdjacencyMatrix(cx)
```
```{r}

```

```{r}
#Among the 2617 and the 662 proteins, we have 542 connected components. 

#226 correspond to single proteins identified by single peptide. 
#0 represent protein groups identified by a single shared peptide
#260 represent single proteins identified by multiple unique peptides:
#Finally, arguable those that warrant additional exploration are those that are composed of multiple peptides and multiple proteins. There are 56 thereof in this identification

#which means there are 662 unique sequences.
#there are no unique database accesses recorded in the dataset.
#there are 542 connected components in the graph.
#The line (i <- which(nrows(cc) > 2 & ncols(cc) > 2)) identifies the indices of connected components that have more than 2 rows and more than 2 columns.
#The output dims(cc)[i, ] shows the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of these selected connected components
#12 components have more than 2 rows and more than 2 columns, with varying sizes.
```
