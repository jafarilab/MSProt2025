# üß¨ Capstone Project: R-based Mass Spectrometry Proteomics Workflow
  
#This document provides a step-by-step guide for your capstone project on analyzing proteomics data using R.

---
  
## üîÅ Workflow Overview
  ### 1. üìÅ Dataset Acquisition  
  #**Input:** PRIDE PXD Identifier  
 
#(*Example: `PXD0123456`, accessible via [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/)*)

#Use the `rpx` package to access metadata and download a dataset that includes `.mzID` files from a published study.
```{r}
library(rpx)
px <- PXDataset("PXD054877")  # Create a PXDataset object for the dataset with ID "PXD056514" #female
pxfiles(px) ## Retrieve and display a list of all files associated with the PXDataset object 'px'

```

```{r}
files <- pxfiles(px) #Retrieve and display a list of all files associated with the PXDataset object 'px'
mzid_files <- pxget(px, grep("mzid", pxfiles(px))) #Identify the .mzID files from the retrieved files
```


---
  
### 2. üß± PSM Object Creation & Preprocessing  
#**Goal:** Generate a PSM (Peptide-Spectrum Match) object from `.mzID` files  
 
#- Convert `.mzID` files into `PSM` objects
# Assess:
# Number of decoy hits
# Score distributions
# PSM rank
# Apply filtering based on FDR or identification score

```{r}
library(PSMatch)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
psms <- PSM(mzid_files, parser = 'mzID') #Convert .mzID files into PSM objects
```

```{r}
names(psms)
```
```{r}
# PSM rank
#    * Number of decoy hits
#no isdecoy column
library("dplyr")
psm_df <- tidyr::as_tibble(psms)
psm_df
#Converted into dataframe because it is just easier to check in environment and easier to work on for me. Please ignore this if you don't want to do dataframe and read the columns in similar way as line 58 hist script :) but the dataframe is for exploring and visualization only. we will do filtering in actual object psms in later steps
sum(is.na(psm_df$description)) #0 #one way is to check if there are proteins without description. -> No NAs in description
#Another idea we discussed was that if the peak score is low (for eg 0), they could be removed as decoy. So I will come back to that in later step after score distribution
```


```{r}
#    * Number of decoy hits
#no isdecoy column
#Converted into tibble because it is just easier to check in environment and easier to work on for me. as  hist script :) 
sum(is.na(psm_df$description)) #0 #one way is to check if there are proteins without description. -> No NAs in description
#Another idea we discussed was that if the peak score is low (for eg 0), they could be removed as decoy. So I will come back to that in later step after score distribution
```



```{r}
#Score distributions
# Score distributions
score_distribution <- summary(psms@listData$`mascot:score`)
print(score_distribution)
#hist(psms@listData$`mascot:score`, breaks = 100) #one way to do histogram

table(psm_df$passthreshold) #true#57251 may be after removing decoys or delta score or mascot score thereshold? 

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(psm_df, aes(x = mascot.score)) +
  geom_density()+
   labs(title = "Density Plot of Mascot Scores",
       x = "Mascot Score",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal() 
```
```{r}

#when filtering one plan is to remove everything at 0. just exploring where to filter
ggplot(psm_df, aes(x = mascot.score)) +
  geom_density(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.5) +  # Fill color for the density plot
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +  # Vertical line at x = 1

       x = "Mascot Score",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_minimal() 
```


```{r}

#plot <- ggplot(psm_df, aes(x = mascot.score)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +  # Fill color for the density plot
#  geom_vline(xintercept = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +  # Vertical line at x = 1

```{r}
# PSM rank
psm_rank_distribution <- table(psm_df$rank)
print(psm_rank_distribution) #we dont have many that have higher rank
```

```{r}
#Apply filtering based on FDR or identification score ?
psms <- psms %>% filterPsmRank() #keeping only those with rank 1 #skip this?
psms <- filterPsmFdr(psms, FDR = 0.05, fdr = psmVariables(psms)["fdr"], verbose = TRUE) #if we had fdr column, we don't have that column
psm_df <- tidyr::as_tibble(psms)
orig_df <- nrow(psm_df)
psm_df <- psm_df %>% filter(mascot.score > 0) #filtering based on identification score becuase we do not have decoys adn fdr in this data
filtered_df <- nrow(psm_df)
number_of_decoys <- orig_df -filtered_df
(number_of_decoys) 
```

```{r}
adjacencyMatrix(psms)
```





  
### 3. üß¨ Protein & Peptide Identification  
# **Goal:** Determine identified peptides and proteins  
#Count the number of identified peptides and proteins
#Review peptide-to-protein mapping:
#Razor proteins
#Protein groups
```{r}
describePeptides(psms) #number of peptides in unfiltered dataset

dim(psm_df)
nrow(psm_df)
length(unique(psm_df$pepseq)) #peptides #1644 after filtering
length(unique(psm_df$accession)) #proteins? #431
```

```{r}
adj <- makeAdjacencyMatrix(psms) #this one is without the mascot.score <0 removed because i dont know how to convert tibble to psm again. but rank 1 is filtered. 
dim(adj)
```
```{r}
length(unique(psms$sequence))
length(unique(psms$DatabaseAccess))
cc <- ConnectedComponents(adj)
length(cc)
cc
(i <- which(nrows(cc) > 2 & ncols(cc) > 2))
dims(cc)[i, ]
cx <- connectedComponents(cc, 260) #has 5 proteins, they share some peptides with another. 
cx
plotAdjacencyMatrix(cx)
```
```{r}
(i <- which(nrows(cc) > 1 & ncols(cc) > 1))
length(i)
razor_prot <- as.data.frame(dims(cc[i,]))
#Protein groups that have at least one connection to another protein and at least one peptide.
```

```{r}
(i <- which(nrows(cc) > 1 & ncols(cc) == 1))
length(i)
#Protein groups that have at least one connection to another protein and at least one peptide.
```


```{r}
#file <- paste0("/Users/adhisadi/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-UniversityofHelsinki/School_work/2025-03_Proteomics/Proteomics_git_project/capestone/figures/female/", #"one_multiple_peptides_and_multiple_proteins_outOf_40.png")
#png(file, height=2500,width=2500,res=200)
#plotAdjacencyMatrix(cx)
#dev.off()
```

```{r}
cc
```
```{r}
connectedComponents(cc,1)
connectedComponents(cc,201)
```
```{r}
cc_dims <- as.data.frame(dims(cc))
colnames(cc_dims) <- c("num_of_rows", "num_of_cols")
cc_dims <- cc_dims %>% filter(num_of_cols>1)
```

```{r}
cc_dims <- as.data.frame(as.matrix(adj))
cc_dims[] <- ifelse(cc_dims == 0, 0, 1)
cc_dims$row_sum <- rowSums(cc_dims)
cc_dims <- cc_dims %>% filter(row_sum > 1)
cc_dims <- cc_dims %>% select(row_sum)
```

```{r}
#Among the 1817 and the 464 proteins, we have 363 connected components. 

#164 correspond to single proteins identified by single peptide. 
#0 represent protein groups identified by a single shared peptide
#159 represent single proteins identified by multiple unique peptides:
#Finally, arguable those that warrant additional exploration are those that are composed of multiple peptides and multiple proteins. There are 40 thereof in this identification

#which means there are 464 unique sequences.
#there are no unique database accesses recorded in the dataset.
#there are 363 connected components in the graph.
#The line (i <- which(nrows(cc) > 2 & ncols(cc) > 2)) identifies the indices of connected components that have more than 2 rows and more than 2 columns.
#The output dims(cc)[i, ] shows the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of these selected connected components
#10 components have more than 2 rows and more than 2 columns, with varying sizes, the largest being 244 rows by 29 columns.
```
