# How to execute scripts

Please, clone this repository to your local computer. In RStudio make it as a working directory (with `setwd()`). Place all files from Zenodo repository inside this working directory.

## Team 1
Download EncyclopeDIA `encyclopedia-4.7.11-executable.jar` executable from [repository](https://bitbucket.org/searleb/encyclopedia/downloads/) and Team1_ input files from Zenodo. Place everything in the working directory of this repository on your local computer. Then, run the script.

## Team 2
Download Team2_ input files from Zenodo. Place everything in the working directory of this repository on your local computer. Then, run the script.

If you want to run the MaxQuant in the same manner as the team did, please use `Team2_mqpar.xml` and `Team2_uniprotkb_proteome_UP000006548_AND_revi_2025_05_22.fasta` from Zenodo.

## Team 3
Download Team3_ input files from Zenodo. Place everything in the working directory of this repository on your local computer. Then, run the script.

If you want to run the MaxQuant in the same manner as the team did, please use `Team3_mqpar.xml` and `Team3_uniprotkb_AND_reviewed_true_AND_model_o_2025_05_22.fasta` from Zenodo.

## Team 4
Download Team4_ input files from Zenodo. Place everything in the working directory of this repository on your local computer. Then, run the script.

If you want to run the MaxQuant in the same manner as the team did, please use `Team4_MaxQuant_parameters.txt` from Zenodo.

## Team 5
Download Team5_ input files from Zenodo. Place everything in the working directory of this repository on your local computer. Then, run the script.

Script can be executed only up to step 4. The quantification data was requested from data creators under non-disclosure agreement.
